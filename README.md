Project: TAU-Robot Simulator

This is a C++ project, designed to work under Windows and Linux.

You are an algorithm developer in an autonomous robotic vacuum cleaner company. You and your colleagues have developed several algorithms for the robots. Your manager asked you to develop a simulator to test the different algorithms for the robotic cleaner, compare between them and decide on the best algorithm. He also wants you to develop a visual (GUI) simulation to present visually how the algorithms actually run and to see their decisions in a simulation.
